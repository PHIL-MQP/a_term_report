The fundamental contributions of our proposal are: (1) a perceptual grouping process that permits the robust identification and localization of environmental features, such as straight segments and corners, from the sparse and noisy sonar data; (2) a map joining technique that allows the system to build a sequence of independent constant-size stochastic maps and join them in a globally consistent and optimal way; (3) a robust mechanism to determine which features in a stochastic map correspond to the same environment feature, allowing the system to update the stochastic map accordingly, and perform tasks such as revisiting and loop closing.},

	doi = {10.1109/EATIS.2016.7520101},
	abstract = {Currently there are many robots that take place indoors with both industrial and domestic applications. Here, an accurate localization is essential to provide them with features such as autonomy and artificial intelligence. However, indoor localization is a problem not fully resolved by the scientific community. One problem of indoor environments is that the walls and ceilings block GPS (global positioning systems) signals that can provide position coordinates. Consequently, it is necessary to use feature extraction and/or measurements performed along the trajectory. Unfortunately, problems such as uncertainty arise when any measurement is made. A solution to solve such problems is a probabilistic framework with state control of the mobile robot besides making a correction step following the dynamic system progress. Hence, this work proposes a cheap sonar based on four ultrasonic sensors, to measure the distance to four landmarks on environment. The readings obtained from the sensors, combined with odometry data correspond to entries for a particle filter. Accordingly, the main contribution of this work is the attenuation of uncertainty through a cheap localization system. The algorithm uses sonar like a second point of view of environment and reduces the uncertainty at each iteration of the particle filter.},

An algorithm for, model-based localization that relies on the concept of a geometric beacon, a naturally occurring environment feature that can be reliably observed in successive sensor measurements and can be accurately described in terms of a concise geometric parameterization, is developed. The algorithm is based on an extended Kalman filter that utilizes matches between observed geometric beacons and an a priori map of beacon locations. Two implementations of this navigation algorithm, both of which use sonar, are described. The first implementation uses a simple vehicle with point kinematics equipped with a single rotating sonar. The second implementation uses a `Robuter' mobile robot and six static sonar transducers to provide localization information while the vehicle moves at typical speeds of 30 cm/s},

In this paper, we propose an improved beacon system, having the ultrasonic media type, which can be used for indoor localization; Moreover it can estimate the direction of a mobile object by using a digital compass. However it is very hard for the indoor localization system using ultrasonic sensors to achieve much highly precise localization for mobile objects since the ultrasonic sensor is highly sensitive to noises and external shocks. In order to overcome this problem, we adopt a bandpass-filter to protect ultrasonic sensor from another frequency generated by noise and external shocks. In addition, the multi-modulation of ultrasonic sensors - using two ultrasonic sensors with different frequencies - improves the sampling rate of this system. And we present the application of Unscented Kalman Filter to improve the localization performance of our indoor mobile localization system.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of tracking a moving device under two indoor location architectures: an active mobile architecture and a passive mobile architecture. In the former, the infrastructure has receivers at known locations, which estimate distances to a mobile device based on an active transmission from the device. In the latter, the infrastructure has active beacons that periodically transmit signals to a passively listening mobile device, which in turn estimates distances to the beacons. Because the active mobile architecture receives simultaneous distance estimates at multiple receivers from the mobile device, it is likely to perform better tracking than the passive mobile system in which the device obtains only one distance estimate at a time and may have moved between successive estimates. However, an passive mobile system scales better with the number of mobile devices and puts users in control of whether their whereabouts are tracked.We answer the following question: How do the two architectures compare in tracking performance? We find that the active mobile architecture performs better at tracking, but that the passive mobile architecture has acceptable performance; moreover, we devise a hybrid approach that preserves the benefits of the passive mobile architecture while simultaneously providing the same performance as an active mobile system, suggesting a viable practical solution to the three goals of scalability, privacy, and tracking agility.},

Hence, correlations using wideband signals or wire connections between base stations have been used to synchronize the base stations; however, these approaches result in additional operating costs. Thus, the proposed algorithm does not require synchronization between base stations. The TDOA equations are derived by continuously varying the locations of the source and the location of a base station. The number of packets necessary for localization is also reduced.

	abstract = {This PhD work has the goal to develop an inexpensive, easily deployable and widely compatible localization system for indoor use, suitable for pre-installed public address sound systems, avoiding costly installations or significant architectural changes in spaces. Using the audible sound range will allow the use of low cost off-the-shelf equipment suitable for keeping a low deployment cost. The state-of-the-art presented in this paper evidences a technological void in low-cost, reliable and precise localization systems and technologies. This necessity was also confirmed by the authors in a previous project (NAVMETRO¬Æ) where no suitable technological solution was found to exist to overcome the need to automatically localize people in a public space in a reliable and precise way.Although research work is in its first steps, it already provides a thorough view on the problem while discussing some possible approaches and predicting strategies to overcome the key difficulties. Some experiments were already conducted validating some initial premises and demonstrating how to measure the signal‚Äôs time-of-flight necessary to infer on distance calculations.},

This paper presents a fusion of an inertial sensor of six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) which comprises the 3-axis of an accelerometer and the 3-axis of a gyroscope, and a vision to determine a low-cost and accurate position for an autonomous mobile robot. For vision, a monocular vision-based object detection algorithm speeded-up robust feature (SURF) and random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithms were integrated and used to recognize a sample object in several images taken. As against the conventional method that depend on point-tracking, RANSAC uses an iterative method to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model from a set of captured data which contains outliers. With SURF and RANSAC, improved accuracy is certain; this is because of their ability to find interest points (features) under different viewing conditions using a Hessain matrix. This approach is proposed because of its simple implementation, low cost, and improved accuracy. With an extended Kalman filter (EKF), data from inertial sensors and a camera were fused to estimate the position and orientation of the mobile robot. All these sensors were mounted on the mobile robot to obtain an accurate localization. An indoor experiment was carried out to validate and evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is fast in computation, reliable and robust, and can be considered for practical applications. The performance of the experiments was verified by the ground truth data and root mean square errors (RMSEs).},

In order to minimize the disturbance to the user and to provide the ease of installation, the passive landmarks are used. The landmarks are made of coated film which reflects the infrared light efficiently. Infrared light is not visible, but the camera can capture the reflected infrared light. Once the artificial landmark is identified, the robot's relative position/orientation is estimated with respect to the landmark. In order to reduce the number of the required artificial landmarks for a given environment, the pan-tilt mechanism is developed together with the distortion correction algorithm.},

Most available systems apply wireless concepts, optical tracking, and/or ultrasound. This paper presents a standalone IPS using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The concept is based on an object carrying an RFID reader module, which reads low-cost passive tags installed next to the object path. A positioning system using a Kalman filter is proposed. The inputs of the proposed algorithm are the measurements of the backscattered signal power propagated from nearby RFID tags and a tag-path position database. The proposed algorithm first estimates the location of the reader, neglecting tag-reader angle-path loss. Based on the location estimate, an iterative procedure is implemented, targeting the estimation of the tag-reader angle-path loss, where the latter is iteratively compensated from the received signal strength information measurement. Experimental results are presented, illustrating the high performance of the proposed positioning system.},

This scheme doesn't involve explicit point-to-point message passing or routing; instead, it diffuses information across the network by updating each node's data with a weighted average of its neighbors' data (they maintain the same data structure). At each step, every node can compute a local weighted least-squares estimate, which converges to the global maximum-likelihood solution. This scheme is robust to unreliable communication links. We show that it works in a network with dynamically changing topology, provided that the infinitely occurring communication graphs are jointly connected.},

Our solution is based on coded exposure imaging which, as we show, enables well-posed de-convolution and decoding over a wider range of velocities. To serve this solution, we developed a simple and effective approach for 2D barcode localization under motion blur, a metric for evaluating the quality of the deblurred 2D barcodes, and an approach for motion direction estimation in coded exposure images. We tested our system on real camera images of three popular 2D barcode symbologies: Data Matrix, PDF417 and Aztec Code.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel method to locate the four extreme corners of barcodes in the images captured by mobile phones. To achieve this goal, the two nearly-parallel outer boundary lines are firstly localized by utilizing the prior knowledge of the relative distances and angles between the lines, which are subsequently employed to obtain the initially localized corners. A novel post-localization process based on edge tracing is also proposed to further validate the initially localized corners. This is achieved by setting the constraints in maximum direction change when tracing from the current to the next candidate corners. The distinctive feature of the proposed algorithm lies in the capability of handling those curved barcode images taken by the mobile phones. Experiments conducted on a data set of 1410 images show the accuracy of the corner localization is about 92.3\% and 90.5\% for indoor and outdoor barcode images, respectively. The processing time taken is about 0.8 second using Matlab.},

	abstract = {2D barcodes are widely used in many commercial applications where a scanning device is normally used to capture them. When mobile phones are used to capture 2D barcodes, the obtained images are usually distorted due to cheap camera lens and sensors, handshake and poor lighting conditions. These badly distorted images require a long decoding process which results in an error message generated or wrongly decoded information. In this paper, we propose a two-stage quality measure for the mobile phone captured 2D barcodes in order to reject those poor quality images. The proposed method is based on the global bimodal distribution features and the local finder pattern detection. Experimental results on QR code images show that the proposed two-stage quality measure has 97.64\% prediction accuracy with an average run time of 110ms by rejecting distorted undecodable barcode images in advance. The proposed method also has good generalizability to ‚Äúunseen‚Äù camera models and performs well under different lighting conditions. Experiments on data matrix images show that our quality measure can be extended to 2D barcode patterns with similar features.},

First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.},

An important bottleneck is the computation of 2D-to-3D correspondences required for pose estimation. Current stateof- the-art approaches use indirect matching techniques to accelerate this search. In this paper we demonstrate that direct 2D-to-3D matching methods have a considerable potential for improving registration performance. We derive a direct matching framework based on visual vocabulary quantization and a prioritized correspondence search.

We present our approach to the localization and segmentation of a 2D color barcode in such challenging scenarios, along with its evaluation on a diverse collection of images of Microsoft's recently launched high capacity color barcode (HCCB). We exploit the unique trait of barcode reading: the barcode decoder can give the vision algorithm feedback, and develop a progressive strategy to achieve both - high accuracy in diverse scenarios as well as computational efficiency.},

A localization system with low cost, easy accomplishment, simplicity, effectiveness and robustness is the aim of researchers all the time. Here, we proposed a novel method for localization of mobile robot using ID tag and Web camera. In our method, the path map in an indoor environment is expressed with node tree, every node is represented with two landmarks: ID tag and card with the same colour. Pairs of two landmarks are affixed to ceiling of distinct locations, and the middle point of every pair of landmarks in a node indicates the absolute position or the node because of the unique ID of tag, the absolute position of mobile robot can be expressed with the absolute position of node and, position and orientation relative to this node. Localization is implemented with two steps: detecting ID tag in one node with RF communication and measuring position and orientation of mobile robot relative to this node with camera. In this paper, related works are summarized and the advantages of our method are introduced, the scheme of system is described in detail, a fast image processing algorithm for extracting landmarks from background and strategies for system robustness are discussed. Localization experiments show that with this method the errors or relative position and orientation are less than 2.5 cm and 2.5 degree. Navigation showed us that localization with ID tag and Web camera is feasible for navigation in indoor environment. At last, strategies for improving system are discussed.},
