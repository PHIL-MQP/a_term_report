	abstract = {With the development of satellite and remote sensing techniques, more and more image data from airborne/satellite sensors have become available. Multi-sensor image fusion seeks to combine information from different images to obtain more inferences than can be derived from a single sensor. In image-based application fields, image fusion has emerged as a promising research area since the end of the last century. The paper presents an overview of recent advances in multi-sensor satellite image fusion. Firstly, the most popular existing fusion algorithms are introduced, with emphasis on their recent improvements. Advances in main applications fields in remote sensing, including object identification, classification, change detection and maneuvering targets tracking, are described. Both advantages and limitations of those applications are then discussed. Recommendations are addressed, including: (1) Improvements of fusion algorithms; (2) Development of “algorithm fusion” methods; (3) Establishment of an automatic quality assessment scheme.},

The state-of-the-art presented in this paper evidences a technological void in low-cost, reliable and precise localization systems and technologies. This necessity was also confirmed by the authors in a previous project (NAVMETRO®) where no suitable technological solution was found to exist to overcome the need to automatically localize people in a public space in a reliable and precise way.Although research work is in its first steps, it already provides a thorough view on the problem while discussing some possible approaches and predicting strategies to overcome the key difficulties.

We propose a simple distributed iterative scheme, based on distributed average consensus in the network, to compute the maximum-likelihood estimate of the parameters. This scheme doesn't involve explicit point-to-point message passing or routing; instead, it diffuses information across the network by updating each node's data with a weighted average of its neighbors' data (they maintain the same data structure). At each step, every node can compute a local weighted least-squares estimate, which converges to the global maximum-likelihood solution. This scheme is robust to unreliable communication links. We show that it works in a network with dynamically changing topology, provided that the infinitely occurring communication graphs are jointly connected.},

The concept is based on an object carrying an RFID reader module, which reads low-cost passive tags installed next to the object path. A positioning system using a Kalman filter is proposed. The inputs of the proposed algorithm are the measurements of the backscattered signal power propagated from nearby RFID tags and a tag-path position database. The proposed algorithm first estimates the location of the reader, neglecting tag-reader angle-path loss. Based on the location estimate, an iterative procedure is implemented, targeting the estimation of the tag-reader angle-path loss, where the latter is iteratively compensated from the received signal strength information measurement.

They are classified according to the environment, the purpose of application, the media type and so on. In this paper, we propose an improved beacon system, having the ultrasonic media type, which can be used for indoor localization; Moreover it can estimate the direction of a mobile object by using a digital compass. However it is very hard for the indoor localization system using ultrasonic sensors to achieve much highly precise localization for mobile objects since the ultrasonic sensor is highly sensitive to noises and external shocks. In order to overcome this problem, we adopt a bandpass-filter to protect ultrasonic sensor from another frequency generated by noise and external shocks. In addition, the multi-modulation of ultrasonic sensors - using two ultrasonic sensors with different frequencies - improves the sampling rate of this system. And we present the application of Unscented Kalman Filter to improve the localization performance of our indoor mobile localization system.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of tracking a moving device under two indoor location architectures: an active mobile architecture and a passive mobile architecture. In the former, the infrastructure has receivers at known locations, which estimate distances to a mobile device based on an active transmission from the device. In the latter, the infrastructure has active beacons that periodically transmit signals to a passively listening mobile device, which in turn estimates distances to the beacons. Because the active mobile architecture receives simultaneous distance estimates at multiple receivers from the mobile device, it is likely to perform better tracking than the passive mobile system in which the device obtains only one distance estimate at a time and may have moved between successive estimates. However, an passive mobile system scales better with the number of mobile devices and puts users in control of whether their whereabouts are tracked.We answer the following question: How do the two architectures compare in tracking performance? We find that the active mobile architecture performs better at tracking, but that the passive mobile architecture has acceptable performance; moreover, we devise a hybrid approach that preserves the benefits of the passive mobile architecture while simultaneously providing the same performance as an active mobile system, suggesting a viable practical solution to the three goals of scalability, privacy, and tracking agility.},

Generally, a TDOA-based localization algorithm requires synchronization between base stations in order to improve the accuracy of localization. Hence, correlations using wideband signals or wire connections between base stations have been used to synchronize the base stations; however, these approaches result in additional operating costs. Thus, the proposed algorithm does not require synchronization between base stations. The TDOA equations are derived by continuously varying the locations of the source and the location of a base station. The number of packets necessary for localization is also reduced. The localization performance of the proposed algorithm is verified with Monte-Carlo simulations.},

This paper presents a fusion of an inertial sensor of six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) which comprises the 3-axis of an accelerometer and the 3-axis of a gyroscope, and a vision to determine a low-cost and accurate position for an autonomous mobile robot. For vision, a monocular vision-based object detection algorithm speeded-up robust feature (SURF) and random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithms were integrated and used to recognize a sample object in several images taken. As against the conventional method that depend on point-tracking, RANSAC uses an iterative method to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model from a set of captured data which contains outliers. With SURF and RANSAC, improved accuracy is certain; this is because of their ability to find interest points (features) under different viewing conditions using a Hessain matrix. This approach is proposed because of its simple implementation, low cost, and improved accuracy. With an extended Kalman filter (EKF), data from inertial sensors and a camera were fused to estimate the position and orientation of the mobile robot. All these sensors were mounted on the mobile robot to obtain an accurate localization. An indoor experiment was carried out to validate and evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is fast in computation, reliable and robust, and can be considered for practical applications. The performance of the experiments was verified by the ground truth data and root mean square errors (RMSEs).},
